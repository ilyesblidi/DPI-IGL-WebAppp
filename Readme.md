## Creation of a Web Application for DPI Management

### Overview
DPI stands for "Dossier Patient Informatis√©." It is a digital file that centralizes all the information related to a patient, such as: medical history, treatments, exam results, and medical prescriptions. The DPI facilitates care management, improves communication between healthcare professionals, and enables better continuity of care.
